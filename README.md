# Math Puzzle Game

This Project is a web-based, event driven mathematical puzzle game developed for my course work.

This project uses these fundamnetals:

1. Uses The Bana API for generating mathematical puzzles.

2. Additional APIS for interoperability.

3. Seperate Frontend and Backend with distributed architecture.

4. Authentication for virtual identity

The version control is maintained using Git.
